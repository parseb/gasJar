GAS Refund tip.

Call contract to 'deposit' refunable gas and give the rights to delete to a third party.

- the thrid party should be able to prove the ownership over the gas refund
- the third party should be able to sell/alienate the right to materialize the gas refund

Core idea: what if gas refunds can be currency.. like ETH but for web3.
Call Contract -> Contract instructions: -delete all of this - get gas refund - if enough gas deploy this contract (kindof logic) 
- can such an asset be defi composable?
- can deletion rights over unaccesed data be a way of financing a protocol? (gas refund)

To Do:
- take a closer look at gas-centered projects like gasstation
